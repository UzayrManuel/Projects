# 🔐 Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my projects repository!  
This repo is a collection of hands-on projects, scripts, and documentation that showcase my journey into cybersecurity.  
I am currently studying for the **CompTIA Security+ certification**, and these projects reflect both my learning process and practical applications.
